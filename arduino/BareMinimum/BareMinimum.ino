/* Blue Robotics Example Code
-------------------------------

Title: Bare Minimum for ESC Control (Arduino)

Description: This example code shows the bare minimum to get up and
running with the Blue Robotics Basic ESC and BlueESC using PWM signals.

The code is designed for the Arduino Uno board and can be compiled and
uploaded via the Arduino 1.0+ software.
