/* Blue Robotics Example Code
-------------------------------

Title: Analog Input to ESC Output (Arduino)

Description: This code is an example of how to control the Blue Robotics
Thrusters and ESCs with an analog input signal. This can be useful to work
with devices that output analog signals. The speed is controlled by a 0-5V
analog input and the direction is controlled by a logical input with 0V for
reverse and 5V for forward. The code is designed to operate two thrusters
but can be extended to operate more.

The code is designed for the Arduino Uno board and can be compiled and
uploaded via the Arduino 1.0+ software.
